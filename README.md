# Machine-Learning-Image-Processing-Project
A Machine Learning project where I train and use models for image classification and generation
## Tasks
1. Implement linear and polynomial fitting to data and report the L2 loss
2. Use different feature spaces to identify the most similar image from a database to a sample image
3. Implement a convolutional neural network to denoise an image and compare the resuslts with regular gaussian denoising
4. Extract style from an image and apply it to another image
5. Learn an implicit neural function to predict frames of an animated 2D object
## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pytorch
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
## What I learned
